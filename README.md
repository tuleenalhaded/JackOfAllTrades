**The Universal IoT Control Platform**

One app to control them all. A skeleton framework for companies to build customized device control interfaces without forcing consumers to download separate apps for every appliance.

## Core Concept
- Single app for all IoT devices
- Companies customize UI and functionality for their devices
- Subscription-based model for manufacturers
- Consumer convenience through unified control

## Structure
- `core/` - Base framework (device management, communication, UI engine)
- `examples/` - Two distinct implementations showing versatility
  - Smart thermostat (home appliance)
  - Smart fitness scale (health device)

## Quick Start
```bash
npm start
```

Choose your role:
- **Consumer**: Control all your IoT devices from one interface
- **Company**: Customize UI and integrate your devices

## Demo Examples
```bash
npm run demo:thermostat
npm run demo:scale
```
