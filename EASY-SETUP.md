   - Type this EXACT address:
   ```
   192.168.100.116:8081
   ```
   - Tap "Connect" or "Go"

## Alternative: Test in Browser (No Phone Needed)

**Press the `w` key** and it will open in your browser!

Or manually open: http://localhost:19006

## Troubleshooting

**"Can't connect"**
- Make sure your phone and computer are on the SAME WiFi network
- Try the IP address: `192.168.100.116:8081`

**"Still not working"**
- Press `w` in the terminal to test in browser first
- Make sure the terminal is still running (don't close it!)
